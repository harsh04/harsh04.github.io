In this era of YouTube, Netflix and Amazon prime, we get to watch the most relatable content. It has provided a platform to a dark horse to emerge in a way, to connect to people and put up a point which lies in every single being's conscience.
Zillion of web series and videos go live each minute on YouTube and offer a wide variety for us normal people to watch.
So, if you are a web series maniac (just like me), these shows are a must watch.

I haven't heard of a person who hasn't heard a comment regarding their body because in a society we live, there is a perfect model of a person being some feet tall, some inches wide and that perfect fair face. And it is not possible for everyone to fit in that model, because every person has different genes, diet and lifestyle. And why should someone fit? There lies a bigger question? Why can't one be oneself?

Every now and then a girl hears that she is skinny or fat or dark. It is the way she is, she is born with it and it is not her fault to be like that. All this is influenced by the cover magazine girls or our favorite actors that we keep them as a benchmark to achieve the same kind of body type. But do we really know , what Photoshop edits goes behind that so called perfect picture? That software can convert a pizza into a model. 
I was called skinny the entire time. Well that is my body type and I am comfortable in it. Who gives others the authority to validate if I am perfect or not? People giving all those tips to gain weight and apply some kind of mixtures on my face to have a fair skin, seriously, get some life dear. There are better problems to deal with and getting the exterior perfect won't help at all.

And when this skinny girl puts on some weight, the same people utter negative remarks. Like really, aren't you not satisfied with what I am and don't you take into account how much talent is there inside. 
It's been trending these days but yes, body shaming needs to stop. Everyone can't be the same to fit in society's norms. Why fit in the shoes that are too big? Just pull off your sneakers and paint the town red.
