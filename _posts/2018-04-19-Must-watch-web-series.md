In this era of YouTube, Netflix and Amazon prime, we get to watch the most relatable content. It has provided a platform to a dark horse to emerge in a way, to connect to people and put up a point which lies in every single being's conscience.
Zillion of web series and videos go live each minute on YouTube and offer a wide variety for us normal people to watch.
So, if you are a web series maniac (just like me), these shows are a must watch.

I'm sure this code word is nothing new to you. We all have played and predicted our relationship with our crush with this game.
This web series by the Timeliners is a fresh, new and sweet walk down the memory lane of our innocent love in high school. The struggle to balance studies and love, confession to your crush, a new rumour in air, bunking classes to go on a date, hanging out after class on a momos' stall.. isn't this the story of each of our lives? If yes, go and check out this amazing series and relive the teenager in you.

Aren't we losing ourselves in this race to achieve all the materialistic stuff and getting so far from the happiness and contentment? This series is an eye-opener and will leave you speculating to what you are doing in life.
The protagonist is fired from his job all of a sudden on the same day he buys his dream bike, which leads him to awaken the wanderlust in him, helping him find answers which the road can give and not the destination. A fine work of cinematography and unexplored North-east part of India will definitely awaken the wanderlust in you too.

<h4>The Trip</h4>

The four girls go on a bachelorette trip and find the purpose and right person to live for. It stars Lisa Hayden, Shweta Tripathi (battata wada), Sapna Pabbi and our favourite Mallika Dua. It's a free flowing ride to Thailand (by car.. amazing right?) where girls share what they have been facing and overcoming at last. It's a relatable take on life and leaves you with a reaction 'Oh! So me'.

This series again by the Timeliners is for us middle class fellows. Fighting and arguing over every item to be shopped, the never ending job of a mother, Goa trips that can't be implemented, convincing parents for a love marriage and all this is presented in a humourous way... Laugh at your misery peeps! But yet again a nice and enjoyable saga.

This series is a hilarious take on sex life and without even saying the word sex it expresses everything you know and would want to know. The tragedy of a beginner and view points of girls. So boys, attention. Sit with a pen and paper and take notes for a happening sex life. It will enlighten you to what you assumed and what the reality is. This attempt by Girliyapa will leave you ROFL and come back for more, if you know what I mean!
